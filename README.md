# Toontown-House 
This is a Modified Version Of Toontown House, This Includes the following fixes, Widescreen support, many gui fixes, New unites, New Emotions, new emotions added to catalog, enabled parties, door collisions fixed, garden drop game disabled to stop people cheating and using it as a no collision hack. Clarabell icon put to its correct place instead of in middle of screen. Clarabell Also now talks thanks and credit to ttr and sits in a room. Doodles have had a bit of work to fix a few crashes too. Name tags are now clickable (not fully but supported alot better)
My idea for doing this was after going onto toontown next and looking at how bad widescreen was it had not been ajusted at all so i decided to put together widescreen and enable some other neat fetures i have enjoyed from elsewhere and bring them together 
TTH Supports Panda3d-1.8.1 and Panda3D-1.9.0 but there are a few problems which are noticable with 1.9.0 such as mickey in ttc been squashed to the floor so you are better off using panda 1.8.1
To install download the files, place the Pand3d-1.8.1 folder on your local disc directory like so C:/Panda3d-1.8.1
If you have any other versions of panda3d please rename the end of the folders so tth does not try to use them to load up instead.
Open up the tth folder and double click on Start_localHost To start the game, and once all 3 compand prompts have loaded up open runGame and login with a desired username.

You could also boot up the server by doing the following
open astron.bat
then ai.bat
then ud.bat 
But it is easier to just do it the way i said the first time.
